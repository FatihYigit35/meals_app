# Meals App

What I learned with this project;
- We created widgets in different files and used the same widget over and over again in the application.
- We created variable values ​​that we can use from anywhere in the application with the Riverpod library.
- We enriched the visuals by applying animations to the category list on the home page, to the images in the transitions on the meals and meal details pages, and to the favorite button on the meal details pages
