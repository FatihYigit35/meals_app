# Meals App

What I learned with this project;
- Widgets were created in different files and the same widget was used repeatedly in the application
- Variable values ​​that we can use from anywhere in the application were created with the Riverpod library
- Visuals were enriched by applying animations to the category list on the home page, to the visuals in the transitions on the meal and meal detail pages, and to the favorite button on the meal detail pages
